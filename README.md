                                           PROBLEM
           (i)   You are walking up the Empire State Building and playing a game with your friends
           (ii)  You draw a dice 100 times
                  If :
                       a) 1 or 2   : go one step down (-1)
                       b) 3,4 or 5 : go one step up   (+1)
                       c) 6        : throw dice again and walk resulting no. up (+x)
           (iii) Can't go below step 0
            (iv) Have a chance of 0.1 % falling down the stairs when you move (ie. have to start from step 0)

        NOW YOU BET THAT YOU WILL REACH STEP 60. WHAT IS THE CHANCE THAT YOU WILL WIN THIS BET ?

This shows the step by step way to solve the problem (go from 1 to 9)

File no. 10 Final Code! shows the final solution
